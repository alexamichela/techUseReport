# My Tech Use Report
## Examining The Effects of Controlled Media Consumption

In this project, I will examine my own use of technology both inside and outside of the classroom. In Vallor’s chapter on “Cultivating the Foundations of Technomoral Virtue,” she speaks on the importance of reflective self-examination. By developing a critical eye for one’s actions and attitudes, one can strengthen their abilities for self-control and refrain from mindless self-indulgence. Vallor describes the development of this reflective self-examination in stages. Self-indulgence or incontinence is when one is unaware that their desires are bad and therefore do not move to resist them. It is with knowledge that this evolves into continence, where one is aware of the desires that need controlling. Over time, one can develop temperance, in which one is only moved by truly good desires (Vallor, 2016, p. 85-86).

Through this project, I was interested in learning how my media consumption habits have changed since I have deleted the Instagram and YouTube apps from my phone. I had noticed that in the first few days post-deletion, I would instinctively pick up my phone and navigate to where my Instagram or YouTube apps were located on my home screen. I was curious if the remnants of this “media addiction” would persist over time or if I would no longer have this urge to scroll or find another recipient for my attention. Through quantitative methods and digital traces, I will collect data on the following questions:

* How many times do I find myself trying to find something to scroll through when I’m on a device?
* How many times do I pick up my phone to waste time (not looking at an email notification/without specific intention)?
* How long do I spend scrolling on some media platform?
* How many times do I check/look at my email?*
* What kind of content do I consume on YouTube and the New York Times?
**Originally, I did not count the number of times I checked my email, but on the third day, I realized that I had been substituting my usual media content with my Gmail inbox.*
